# LightFeather - At Home Coding Challenge

Need 2 tabs open in terminal

### 1. Starts up React
client folder -> npm start -> automatically open

### 2. Starts up SpringBoot
lightfeather -> mvn spring-boot:run -> Go to http://localhost:8080/ - most likely get a whitelabel but that's good! we're in business
